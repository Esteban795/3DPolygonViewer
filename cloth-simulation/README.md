# CLOTH SIMULATION (made in C with SDL2) ~~I don't know how to use OpenGL~~

## DISCLAIMER : at first, it was supposed to be only a small part of my [physics-simulation](https://github.com/Esteban795/physics-simulations) repository, but it turned out pretty cool so I decided to make it an entire project. See commits history there if you want the full work progress.

<br />
<br />


### A very light-weight cloth simulation, done in SDL2 & C.

- Runs on an Intel Celeron with two physical and logical cores, @1.10 Ghz. Adds something like 5% CPU usage to the system (and 2% on a ryzen 5 3600 @3.7 Ghz, according to my tests)


- Masses & Springs system, simulated by Hooke's law using Verlet integration. See `update_sticks` function in `src/sticks.c`, and `update_point` function in `src/point.c`.

<br />
<br />



## **Requirements**

- SDL2 is quite obviously a must, since the rendering lib used is SDL2. You can download it on [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) (make sure you linked the .dll file correctly, of course) if you're on Windows, or just do 
```ps 
sudo apt get libsdl2-dev
```
if you're on Linux.

On MacOS, I have no clue if it works since I couldn't test it.

- GCC. or any C compiler should do the job. I've tested with GCC and Clang, and it seems to work fine for me. Don't be afraid to open an issue if it doesn't. (Even if I have no idea if I can solve it).

## How to install it on your computer ?

- Just clone it wherever you want in your computer.

```ps
git clone https://github.com/Esteban795/physics-simulations.git
```

- After that, head to the directory you cloned it in, go to `cloth_simulation` and type
```ps
make build
``` 
- Then, use 
```ps
make run ROWS="NumberOfRowsItShouldHave" COLUMNS="SameButColumns"
```

## How to use it ?

| Keys        | What they do                  |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Left click  | Can drag the cloth            |     |
| Right click | Tears cloth apart             |
| SCROLLWHEEL | Resizes the cursor for tearing| 
| LEFT_ARROW  | Wind impulse, to the.. left.  |
| RIGHT_ARROW | Wind impulse, but to the.. right.|
| ESC         | Exits the program              |

<br />
<br />

## What's left to do ?

- ~~Allow the user to tear apart the cloth when it is dragged too far~~ âœ…
- Why not try in 3D ? I'll see that I guess, ~~once I learn OpenGL~~
